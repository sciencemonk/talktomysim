# SIM - Agentic Storefront Platform

Welcome to **SIM**, the world's first agentic storefront platform that revolutionizes e-commerce by combining AI-powered sales agents with seamless x402 cryptocurrency payments.

## What is SIM?

SIM transforms traditional online stores into intelligent, conversational commerce experiences. Instead of static product catalogs, your customers interact with AI agents that understand their needs, recommend products, and guide them through the purchasing journey—all while accepting payments via the x402 protocol on Solana.

## Key Features

### 🤖 AI Sales Agents

- **Personalized Recommendations**: Smart agents learn customer preferences and suggest relevant products
- **24/7 Availability**: Your AI agent never sleeps, providing instant support around the clock

### 💰 x402 Payments
- **Crypto-Native**: Accept USDC payments on Solana via the x402 protocol

Traditional e-commerce platforms are passive. They display products and wait for customers to make decisions.

Combined with instant crypto payments via x402, SIM represents the future of online commerce.
